At UH Manoa there are many clubs that many people do not know about. To help people find clubs and for clubs to post information for others to join we decided to make an app to help them. For our final project for ICS 314, Kevin, Johnathon, Paulo, and I developed an app called uhmSpacebar to help clubs.
