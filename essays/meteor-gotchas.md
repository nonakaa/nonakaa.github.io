   Meteor is not the easiest thing to learn how to use. It has very long load times. There is not a lot of resources for begginers either. Meteor is a good area for learning how to make app and webpages once you learn how to do everything 
   The first problem I had was with meteor taking a long time to load. When I was doing the digits WOD for the first time it took a long time for it to run. At first I thought it was my computer and did not know that this was an issue and would stop the program because it was taking to long. I later found out that the first time always takes a while, and I had to wait almost one hour. After that first time it still take a few minutes to run, but it is not as long as the first.
   Another problem that I am having is that meteor is a lot more difficult than semantic ui. It is almost the same thing, but there are not as many resources to help teach and it adds more difficult things to it. With using the templates, there are many different files that need to be navigated through to do one thing. The solution to this is to just practice with the WOD and get familliar with them. Many of the coding is the same as semantic ui. It gets confusing when multiple pages are being used and we're not sure which one leads to where.
   While meteor is not the easiest thing to learn and does become difficult with the templates, it does get better.
