The right or wrong thing to do can be defined by ethics. Ethics are the the persons morals and everyones view of ethics are different. If a person has bad morals, then they would most likely have bad ethics. If a person has good morals, then they would most likely have good ethics.

In the case study "The code I'm still ashamed of", the author, Bill Sourour, he talks about a software he designed that he felt unethical about. His assignment started as just job and he did not have a single thought about it. After the site was finished he started having second thoughts about it. He talked to marketing about it, but they had no problem and were happy with the site. Later on a news report came out that was about a girl that used the web site and died from the drug that she was recomended. and after this it changed his view on ehtics.
