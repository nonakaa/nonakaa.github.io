Ethics defines the difference between right or wrong. Ethics are a persons morals and everyones view on ethics are different. If a person has bad morals, they would most likely have bad ethics. If a person has good morals, then they would most likely have good ethics.

In the case study by Bill Sourour "The code I'm still ashamed of," he talks about the software he designed that he felt unethical about. His assignment started as a job and he did not have a single thought about it. After the site was finished, he started to have a second thought about it. He talked to people about marketing it and they had no problem and were happy with the site. Later on the news, a report came out talking about a girl that used the web site and died from the drug that she was recomended. After this, it changed his view on  his ehtics.
