In the 21st century, technology is a large part of our world. Almost everything that we use works because someone else had to write a code for it. Software engineering has become a large field to work in. It gives people a chance to create something of their own to share with others. 
When I was younger, I wanted to be a video game designer. In middle school, I was a programmer for the school’s robotics team. I got to program the robot’s controls to perform multiple tasks. In high school, I took STEM classes for all 4 years and got to attend the STEM Conference on Maui for 3 of them. At the STEM Conferences, I was able to attend various sessions about programming. These activities all helped me make my decision to major in computer science.
I am currently enrolled at UH Manoa and plan to graduate with a bachelor in computer science in spring 2020.  I would like to stay in Hawaii after graduation and be able to work somewhere to strengthen my programming skills. Eventually, I would like to be able to develop my own software that many other users will enjoy.
