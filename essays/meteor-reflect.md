I had a difficult time with learning meteor, but it is the first step to learning how to develop software. With time I believe that I could produce well designed applications or websites that others can use.
Meteor has many dificulties. One of them is the amount of time it takes to set everything up. The first time that meteor runs one a new file takes a while for everything to be set up and installed to be able to run localhost. Another difficult thing was with the templates. It was convienient to have files to copy, but having multiple files become difficult to keep track off at times. When there are multiple files it becomes harder to remember to import all of them and in the correct places too. The biggest problem that I had, had nothing to do with meteor. It was mostly not keeping up with digits so I have to make sure to not fall behind with the rest of the assignments.
One of the things with meteor is using the templates. It gives easy to use code that requires little changes. Publishing websites seem like it will be a lot easier with meteor compared to using semantic ui and starting from scratch.
Using meteor is completely new to me and I do not have much experience with designing websites, but meteor has gave a great way to start.
