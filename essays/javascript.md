JavaScript is one of the most used coding styles in the world. It is very simple for people to learn how to use. Using websites such as CodeCamp make it so that anyone with access to the internet can learn how to code in a few hours. 
JavaScript is similar to java and python, which are both types of programming languages that I have used before. The main difference is how some of the commands are worded. For example, Java uses var, while JavaScript uses let or cons. 
CodeCamp is a very good website to use to learn about coding. It will teach all the basic codes needed to get started with programming. It also is useful as a study guide to help people refresh their memory or to just practice coding. 
I think that JavaScript is a good programming language for software engineering. It is used by many other software engineers and is similar to java and python, which is also highly used programming languages. This makes it easy for anyone that knows JavaScript, to be able to use java or python when needed. It is also easy for anyone to learn how to program with JavaScript.
Athletic software engineering is very good for teaching problem-solving programs in a timely manner. Doing practice WODs help by giving a different situation to have to problem solve for. The practice WODs in partners is more enjoyable because thereâ€™s not as much stress to make sure you finish in the time allowed. The actual WODs are a little more difficult and more stressful, but it is something that we need to get used to for the work environment of a software engineer.
